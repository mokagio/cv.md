## Bio

I was born in and grew up in Italy.
After getting a B.S. in Software Engineering and a couple of experiences in the local web development industry, I got a one-way ticket to London, in search of an iOS job and personal growth.

I was lucky enough to not only find that but a partner as well.
When Nadine’s UK visa finished, and she had to fly back home to Australia, it was easy for me to go along.
We’ve been living in the beautiful Mornington Peninsula, one hour south of Melbourne, for the past six years, and decided to start our family here.

As the father of a 3-year-old boy and an 8-month-old girl, I spend my spare time playing and doing activities.
Right now, our favorite thing to do with my son is to go swimming, and we’ll start lessons with my daughter too in a few months.
I love reading picture books to them.

When the kids go to bed, I enjoy reading.
My favorite genres are business, productivity, and Stoic philosophy, as well as sci-fi novels.
Still, I’ll pick up anything if a friend recommends it.
